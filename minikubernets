2. Verify Docker is running
bash:
docker info

Look for Server Version and Running: true.
3. Create a Kubernetes Deployment

kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image=nginx



. Scale the deployment to
4 replicas
kubectl scale deployment my-nginx --replicas=4

5. Verify the pods are running
kubectl get pods
You should see 4 pods with names like my-nginx-xxxxxx in Running state.

ou should see 4 pods with names like my-nginx-xxxxxx in Running state.
6. (Optional) Expose the deployment
kubectl expose deployment my-nginx --type=NodePort --port=80
minikube service my-nginx
